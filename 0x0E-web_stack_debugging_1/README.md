# Web Stack Debugging #1

This project is the second installment in a series of web stack debugging projects. The objective of these projects is to troubleshoot and fix broken or bugged web stacks within isolated containers. For each task, a script is created to automate the necessary commands for restoring the web stack to a functional state.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

### 1. Nginx Likes Port 80

#### `0-nginx_likes_port_80`

Bash script that configures Nginx to run and listen to port 80 on all of a server's active IPv4 addresses. This ensures that Nginx is properly configured to handle web traffic on the standard HTTP port.

### 2. Make It Sweet and Short

#### `1-debugging_made_short`

Bash script designed to configure Nginx to listen to port 80 without running on all of a server's active IPv4 addresses. The goal is to streamline the configuration while maintaining functionality. This task aims to achieve a concise and effective solution for Nginx configuration.
