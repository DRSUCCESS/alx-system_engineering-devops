# Networking Basics #0

This project is the first of two introducing fundamental networking concepts. It covers the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols. In this project, you'll find answers to quiz-like questions and bash scripts that help reinforce these networking concepts.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

### 0. OSI Model

[0-OSI_model](0-OSI_model): A text file answering questions related to the OSI model, such as its definition and organizational structure.

### 1. Types of Network

[1-types_of_network](1-types_of_network): A text file answering questions about different types of networks, including the network Holberton iMacs are connected to and networks used for various purposes.

### 2. MAC and IP Address

[2-MAC_and_IP_address](2-MAC_and_IP_address): A text file explaining what MAC and IP addresses are and their significance in networking.

### 3. UDP and TCP

[3-UDP_and_TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP): A text file addressing questions related to UDP and TCP, including their characteristics and usage.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports

[4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports): A bash script that displays listening ports, showing the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network

[5-is_the_host_on_the_network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network): A bash script that pings an IP address received as an argument five times to check if the host is on the network.

These tasks are designed to deepen your understanding of networking fundamentals.
